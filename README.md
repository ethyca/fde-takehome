# âš¡Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) Take Home Skills Assessment

## ðŸ“• Overview: Ethyca Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) Skills Assessment
Welcome to the FDE skills assessment! We're excited about your interest in the role and hope this activity will give us an idea about how you navigate around a new technical environment. We are constantly shipping updates and the product is forever changing (improving!) so being nimble is a must.

This assessment should take less than than 2 hours (3 max!) and is meant to help us understand how you navigate a technical product and perform techniacl tasks. When you are done, we'll have some time on a call to review your progress and both ask and answer any questions.

The goal here is to get familiar with Fides as a product as well as our [documentation site](https://ethyca.com/docs) and show how you would create and manipulate resources via the API. We will be focused on a `System` and a `Dataset`, but if you have any extra time feel free to explore other types as well.

### ðŸš€ Let's get started!
1. Navigate to the Fides [quick start](https://github.com/ethyca/fides?tab=readme-ov-file#rocket-quick-start) of the Fides Readme.
2. Follow the steps through _**"running an example privacy request"**_ to be sure everything is set up correctly.
3. We deviate here and head to the expansive API Fides exposes, you can see the Swagger docs at http://localhost:8080/docs
use `fidesadmin` & `fidesadminsecret` as the client and client secret to authenticate.
4. Spend a little time getting familiar with the System and Dataset resource types and endpoints. You should be able to cross-reference between the API and Admin UI.
5. Create your own imaginary System and accompanying Dataset manually via the API.
    * Explore a couple of different attributes of the System and Dataset.
    * Your Dataset should have 2-3 collections (again, imaginary) with varying amounts of fields that may contain personal data.
    * If there is any extra time, try to understand what attributes may be required on a field for processing a Data Subject Request.
    * Creating an integration for the System is out of scope for this assessment.

### ðŸ”¬ After
Please schedule a follow up meeting with your appointed hiring manager directly or contact the [careers team](mailto:careers@ethyca.com)! Upon meeting, it would be ideal to have your local Fides session up live so we can explore a bit together and talk about how you found using the product.
Again, please limit your time accordingly! This isn't about reaching a correct solution as much as understanding how you work best when faced with a new tech stack. Also, don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or clarifications that may be required.
